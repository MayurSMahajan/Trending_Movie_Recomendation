# Trending_Movie_Recomendation
This is a cross platform software that shows the trending movies across various genres. The end product will be an application with different tables that show ranking of movies based on their current popularity. User can add new movies, and vote available movies, these votes by users will be counted every time there is a new vote uploaded. The more number of votes for a movie means the more popular it is. We will create this application using Flutter and SpringBoot API. We will use a 'No Code, Low Code' tool that is EasyManage studio(https://www.easymanage.com/) to generate most of the boilerplate code and then customize the application according to our need thus speeding our development time.
